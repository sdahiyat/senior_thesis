# ðŸ§¬ SpliceAI Motif Interspersion and Shuffling Experiments

This project explores how SpliceAI responds to engineered changes in transcript sequences through two  strategies:

-  **Codon and Nucleotide Shuffling:** Generate randomized transcriptomes by shuffling within exonic regionsâ€”either by nucleotide or codon frequencyâ€”while preserving introns and junction structure.
- **Motif Interspersion Experiments:** Systematically insert splicing-related sequence motifs upstream or downstream of canonical splice junctions to test their impact on SpliceAI's predictions.

These experiments aim to probe what sequence features SpliceAI has learned and how localized motif presence influences splicing predictions.
