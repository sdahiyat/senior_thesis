The full datasets used to train and evaluate the model are too large to upload to GitHub. Instead, I have included smaller example files that illustrate the structure and format of each dataset.

The original datasets used to construct the canonical splicing dataset, such as `knownGene`, `knownCanonical`, and reference genome sequences, can be accessed through the [SpliceAI GitHub repository](https://github.com/Illumina/SpliceAI) and associated documentation.

For convenience, I've preserved the relevant formatting and file structure in the example files to make it easy to adapt this code to the full dataset.
